### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Paolo aka gentax
#### Frontend lover
![Frontend lover](https://github.com/gentax/gentax/blob/master/images/aws-summit.jpg?raw=true)

Skills in managing projects and team work, built up over years working as a self-employed professional or employee and project manager in the web area.

Experience of relationships with contractors/clients when presenting and negotiating projects.

Flexibility in organizing workload learnt from the need to manage various projects simultaneously in order to meet clientsâ€™ needs.

---

It all started with the love for web design, that evolved in the years to love for all frontend area, from HTML5 to CSS3 to Javascript Module Pattern to the modern Vuejs.

Then arrived the love for the lambda application, the power to serve API with easy and scalability, in Nodejs.

I love #Amazon serverless AWS ecosystem.

Actually, I work as a senior engineer for [CondÃ© Nast Italia](https://www.condenast.it).
